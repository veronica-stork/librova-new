the BaseLibraryScraper, how the Orchestrator routes tasks, and how the utils/filtering.py bouncer intercepts private events like "Baby Sprinkles."
Temporal Resilience via Parent Abstraction: To resolve "All Day" event failures in LibCal and "New Year Rollover" bugs in Assabet, I implemented a polymorphic parse_datetime method in BaseLibraryScraper. This allows children to pass either raw ISO strings or human-readable HTML components, which are then normalized into a standard UTC-ready datetime object before reaching the database layer.
Orchestration via Template Method: To ensure consistent execution across different vendors, the BaseLibraryScraper defines a run() method. This ensures that every adapter follows the same two-step lifecycle (Fetch -> Normalize), while allowing child classes to implement the specific logic for how those steps are performed.
